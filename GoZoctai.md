# Gathers

> Gather creation is done in 2 steps, first a signup is created, then when signup is complete, a gather is generated based on the information from the signup. If teams are predetermined, the signup step should be able to be skipped. (to mostly be used in API and not with discord bot)
>
> a Bo3 is simply a collection of 3 gathers, with a thin wrapper that only holds the aggregate score of the individual gathers.
